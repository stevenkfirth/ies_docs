IES-VE Python API documentation (unofficial)
============================================

I have written this unofficial documentation to the IES-VE Python API to support my undergraduate and postgraduate teaching.

The offical help guide from IES is `here <https://help.iesve.com/ve2025/python_api_guidance.htm?ms=AhAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBAAiABQA%3D%3D&st=MA%3D%3D&sct=MTg3&mw=MzEx>`__.

I've made this available in case it is useful to others. 

For more information and if you have any questions, please see my website: `www.stevenfirth.com`_.
