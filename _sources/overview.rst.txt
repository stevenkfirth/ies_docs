------------------------------

The IES-VE software has an interface which allows Python scripts to control and automate the IES-VE project. This interface can be seen in the IES-VE software via the menu items: `Tools/VE Scripts`.

The "IES-VE Python API" is the unique set of Python classes and methods which can be used in this interface to control and automate the IES-VE project.

Why learn the IES-VE Python API?
--------------------------------

Using Python in IES-VE, you can:

- automate making changes to the model, such as changing the properties of all the windows at once. 
- automate simulation runs, such as running 100 simulations as part of a parametric analysis.
- automate the analysis and presentation of results, such as creating unique graphs and tables and exporting these to Word or Excel.
